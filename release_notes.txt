FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2
=================================

Features
--------
- API debug Checker 
- Changes to improve "High Velocity Ghosting" situations.

Changes
-------
- Changes to Luminance computation with pre-exposure application.
- Small motion vectors ignored in previous depth estimation.
- Changes to depth logic to improve disocclusion detection and avoid self-disocclusions.
- Dilated reactive mask logic updated to use temporal motion vector divergence to kill locks.
- New lock luminance resource.
- Accumulation overhauled to use temporal reactivity.
- Changed how intermediate signals are stored and tonemapped.
- Luminance instability logic improved.
- Tonemapping no longer applied during RCAS to retain more dynamic range.
- Fixes for multiple user reported issues on GitHub and elsewhere. Thank you for your feedback!

Limitations
-----------
- The precise configuration and contents of the reactivity mask is subject to change in a future version of FSR2.

Known issues
------------
- The Vulkan version of the FSR2 sample application experiences a crash on Intel i9-10900K products.
- The Vulkan version of the FSR2 sample application experiences a crash when using the function keys to toggle between scaling modes on some NVIDIA hardware.
